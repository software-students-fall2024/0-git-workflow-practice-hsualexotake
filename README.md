# New Amazon company policy

Amazon recently announced a significant change in its company culture, requiring employees to return to the office five days a week starting January 2nd, 2025. Since the pandemic, remote and hybrid work arrangements have become the norm, so this decision has sparked considerable backlash. Currently, Amazon is requiring employees to be in office at least 3 times a week. However, Iâ€™m curious about the potential ripple effects on other tech giants. Could this move influence companies like Meta and Google to follow suit? Amazon's CEO has expressed his interest to run the company like "the world's biggest startup." This perspective and the new changes could possibly be signaling a broader shift in how the tech industry approaches workplace flexibility.
